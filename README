# What is it?
The soundtrack for your office

# Kanban
## Ideas, things I might add
- hit list, top 10 played sounds
- my favorites - store sound name in cookie
- tags for sounds
-- show links to tag per sound
-- list all sounds per tag
- possibility to add a picture per sound
- comments on the sound page, via disqus
- button to copy URL for autoplay to clipboard (ZeroClipboard)

## Todo
- buy booring.com
- configure booring.com to point to boooring.herokuapp.com
- More sounds:
-- Aaaah from Exalicbur
-- Doh!
-- Yes!
-- Noooooooooooooo
-- Hammarbyklacken

- Superslick layout - buy from someone
- Ads on the page

## Doing

## Done
