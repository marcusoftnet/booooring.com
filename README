## Ideas, things I might add

- my favorites - store sound name in cookie
- tags for sounds
-- show links to tag per sound
-- list all sounds per tag
- possibility to add a picture per sound
- loop sounds
- button to copy URL for autoplay to clipboard (ZeroClipboard)

## Todo
- Jquery to update the number of plays

- More sounds:
-- angleChoir; Aaaah from Exalicbur

-- Yes!
-- Noooooooooooooo

-- Clap clap clapclapclap

- Superslick layout - buy from someone?
- Ads on the page
