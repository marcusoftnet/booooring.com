## Ideas, things I might add
- hit list, top 10 played sounds
- my favorites - store in cookie
- tags for sounds
-- show links to tag per sound
-- list all sounds per tag
- possibility to add picture per sound
- comments for the sound page, via disqus

## Todo
- store the number of plays per sound
- show the number of plays each sound has been played
- More sounds:
-- Aaaah from Exalicbur
-- Doh!
-- Yes!
-- Noooooooooooooo
-- Hammarbyklacken
