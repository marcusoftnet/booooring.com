# What is it?
The soundtrack of your office

# Kanban
## Ideas, things I might add
- hit list, top 10 played sounds
- tags for sounds
-- show links to tag per sound
-- list all sounds per tag
- possibility to add a picture per sound
- loop sounds

## Todo
- sort home page on number of plays
- my favorites - store my favorites sounds
- Link to github issues to ask for more sounds
- More sounds:
-- Hammarbyklacken
-- Clap clap clapclapclap
-- That'd be great!
-- Sheep
-- Chicken
